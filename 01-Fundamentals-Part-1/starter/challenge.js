/*Coding Challenge #1

Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
Â§ Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
m tall.
Â§ Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
m tall.

const markWeight = 78;
const markHeight = 1.69;
const JohnWeight = 95;
const johnHeight = 1.95;
const markBmi = markWeight / markHeight ** 2;
const johnBmi = (JohnWeight / johnHeight) ** 2;
const markHigherBmi = markBmi > johnHeight;
console.log(markBmi, johnBmi, markHigherBmi);


challenge #2:
Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and
improve it.
Your tasks:
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message
is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
Hint: Use an if/else statement ðŸ˜‰ 

const markWeight = 78;
const markHeight = 1.69;
const JohnWeight = 95;
const johnHeight = 1.95;
const markBmi = markWeight / markHeight ** 2;
const johnBmi = (JohnWeight / johnHeight) ** 2;
const markHigherBmi = markBmi > johnHeight;

if (markHigherBmi) {
  console.log(`Mark's BMI( ${markBmi}) is higher than John's(${johnBmi})!`);
} else {
  console.log(`John's BMI(${johnBmi}) is higher than Mark's(#{markBmi})!`);
}
